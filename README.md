Once you plan your day with our app - you'll never forget to feed the dog or pick up your son from preschool again.

Proman is a planning application. It is simple and easy to use. 

With Proman you can, for example, plan your shopping or make a to-do list for the week. 

Also public tables can be edited by everyone and it's very convenient, because if someone comes up with an idea - he can add a new card in the table.
